# TunnelTracker-Radar-Monitoring-System-for-Tunnels
TunnelTracker: Radar Monitoring System for Tunnels is implemented in C++, offering robust functionality for real-time surveillance and control of vehicle speeds within tunnels.

TunnelTracker is a project that I developed as part of my Computer Engineering course at the University of Granada. This subject, Programming Methodology, teaches us to address complex programming problems in a structured and efficient way. Using the C++ programming language, we have created TunnelTracker to manage traffic in a specific tunnel.

The reason the code is in Spanish is because I am Spanish and I prefer to work in my own language. This does not affect the functionality of the program, it simply makes it more accessible and comfortable for me.

In TunnelTracker, we enter the number of cars that we want to register in the tunnel, then we enter the entry time in seconds and the same with the exit time and finally the car's license plate. This tunnel specifically has a length of 17.45 kilometers and a speed limit of 90 km/h. If any car exceeds this speed, the program will automatically apply a fine.

For each registered car, we enter the entry and exit time in seconds, along with its license plate. The program calculates the average speed of the car inside the tunnel and verifies if it exceeds the established limit in addition to doing a small study at the end with the data obtained, in Spanish obviously.

With TunnelTracker we seek to expand our skills beyond the classroom. We set out to learn about the use of structures (structs) to organize data and understand the concept of references (&) in C++ to improve the efficiency of the program and thus avoid “copies” to work instead with the original members.

Enjoy :)
